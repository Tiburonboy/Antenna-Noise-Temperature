Python program to process HARM FTS antenna data for FTSR App G
by Tony Cirineo
Date: Nov 25 , 2018 code copied from HARM_FTS_ver_3.py and modified
Name: HARM AppG TM ver 1
Synopsis: This program will process HARM GPS data.

Description: 

This script will process HARM antenna pattern data.  Data 
is collected in the chamber by 


 need to fix theta and phi <<<<<-------

This script will read the excel file and process the data.  

The FTS antenna has two ports (SMA connectors).  Internally to the antenna 
assembly there are two antenna elements and a combiner/splitter network 
that allows two receivers to be connected to the FTS antenna.  The 
ports are referred to as front and rear and are not labeled 
since they are interchangeable.  

The FTS antenna patterns are measured at three frequencies 424, 425 and 
426 MHz, which are the frequencies for the low end of the band, center 
frequency and the high end of the band.  

Full antenna patterns (4*pi steradian, with a 2 degree step in theta and phi) 
are collected from the front antenna port at each frequency.  A roll antenna 
pattern (2 degree step in phi, theta = 90 degrees) is measured from the rear 
antenna port at each frequency.  This verifies that both antenna ports are 
functional, while reducing data collection time.   

The antenna shall have the following gains:
(a) Roll: The antenna shall have a gain of not less than -23 dBi, over 95% 
of the roll plane (theta = 90 degrees, phi varied).
(b) Nose:  The antenna shall have a gain of not less than -13 dBi over 95% 
of the angles measured at the nose (theta = 0 degrees, phi varied).
(c) Tail:  The antenna shall have a gain of not less than -15 dBi over 95% 
of the angles measured at the tail (theta = 180 degrees, phi varied).
(d) Sphere:  The antenna shall have a gain of not less than -17 dBi
over 95% of the radiation sphere.

The 95% rule for nose, tail and roll planes is coded to not consider the
lowest gains for 5% of the angles when determining the minimum gain in
these planes. 

The 95% of the radiation sphere rule is coded to not consider the lowest
gains which are associated with 5% of the surface of the radiation sphere.



FTS antenna spec...

The angle phi is taken to be zero degrees at the top center of the missile (umbilical location) and measured clockwise as viewed from the tail of the missile.  The angle theta is zero at the missile nose.  See IRIG 253-93, Figure 3-4, for a diagram of the aerodynamic vehicle coordinate system.  

Full antenna patterns (4*pi steradian, with a 2 degree step in theta and phi) 
are collected from the front antenna port at each frequency.  

A roll antenna 
pattern (2 degree step in phi, theta = 90 degrees) is measured from the rear 
antenna port at each frequency.     


Requires: Python version 3 or higher

Calculate the minimum antenna gain over 95% of the radiation sphere. 
1) At AZ = 0 and 180 (nose and tail) take the mean of these values
2) Slice out of the nose and tail data
3) Flatten arrays
4) Append nose and tail averages and area
5) Use Anthony Lin's area code to calculate gain cut off
