# Antenna noise temperature
I've started to gather some information and python code for antenna noise temperature calculations.  For now this repository is a place for me to backup my working files.   

The backup folder contains zip files of work in progress.  The files are developed and run in CoCalc.com, which offers a comprehensive collection of software environments and libraries.  

**ipython notebooks**  
Element pattern: loads a CST file and converts into a numpy array or calculates an theoretical pattern for a circular element.  
Array factor: Calculates the array factor for an hexagonal element pattern.  Saves data to a file.  
Array pattern: Various plots and calculations for the array, like gain and beamwidth.   
Antenna noise temperature: Calculates the antenna noise temperature for the array.  
Hexagonal lattice: calculates the x,y position of array elements
